        <p >The naval <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lagos"><b> Battle of Lagos </b>Battle of Lagos  </a> 
            took place between a British fleet commanded
             by Sir Edward Boscawen and a French fleet under Jean-François 
             de La <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lagos">Clue-Sabran </a>over two days in 1759 during the Seven Years' War. 
             They fought south west of the Gulf of Cádiz on 18 August and to the east of
              the small Portuguese port of Lagos, after which the battle is named, on 19 August.

            La Clue was attempting to evade Boscawen and bring the French Mediterranean 
            Fleet into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lagos">Atlantic   </a>, avoiding battle if possible; he was then under orders
             to sail for the West Indies. Boscawen was under orders to prevent a French breakout 
             into the Atlantic, and to pursue and fight the French if they did. During the evening of 
             17 August the French fleet successfully passed through the Strait of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lagos">Gibraltar  </a> , but was sighted
              by a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lagos"><b>British</b> </a>  ship shortly after it entered the Atlantic. The British fleet was in nearby
